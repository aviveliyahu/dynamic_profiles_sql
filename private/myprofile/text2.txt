The college here in Safed is much more than a place of study, they come here from many places around the country, and from the first day there is a very good camaraderie between the different students, and the formation between everyone becomes very fast. Everyone here helps each other and makes sure that the other succeeds and overcomes the difficulties that studies bring with them
